# Sanity Order Address Fix - Completed

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed route.ts address handling
- Changed address field from `null` to `undefined` when no address is provided
- Added proper error handling for JSON parsing of address data
- Added logging for address parsing failures

### 2. Updated orderType.ts schema
- Removed invalid `nullable` option that was causing TypeScript errors
- Address field now properly handles undefined values

### 3. Improved error handling
- Added try-catch block for address JSON parsing
- Added console logging for debugging address parsing issues

## Changes Made:

**File: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`**
- Changed `address: parsedAddress ? {...} : null` to `address: parsedAddress ? {...} : undefined`
- Added proper error handling for address JSON parsing with try-catch
- Added console logging for address parsing failures

**File: `src/sanity/schemaTypes/orderType.ts`**
- Removed invalid `nullable: true` option from address field definition
- Address field now properly accepts undefined values

## Result:
The Sanity Studio validation error "Invalid property value" for the address field should now be resolved. Orders can be created without addresses, and the schema properly handles undefined address values.
